# EDA Learning Journey 📊

Welcome to **EDA Learning Journey**, a repository where I document my process of learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Each `.md` file in this repository represents notes and insights from a specific workshop or learning session. If you're starting out with EDA or are curious about my learning experience, this repo is a great place to explore!

---

## Repository Structure 📂

This repository is organized into workshop-specific `.md` files, where each file captures:
- **Concepts Covered:** A summary of what was taught.
- **Code Examples:** Python snippets with libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
- **Visualizations:** Plots and graphs to analyze and summarize datasets.
- **Insights:** Key takeaways and patterns observed during the EDA.

### Example Files:
- `workshop1.md` - Introduction to EDA and pandas basics.
- `workshop2.md` - Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.
- `workshop3.md` - Cleaning messy datasets.
- `...` (more to come!)
